        <p class="fundamental"> It is a very exciting and fundamental trip for any muslim person.

        <section>
        <p> There are two types of pilgrimages that can be done, a short one called Umrah and the longer one called Hajj. 
            Umrah pilgrimage can be performed at any time during the year and can be completed within a few days. <br>
            Meanwhile Hajj can only be performed once a year during Ramadan and takes longer due to all the rituals and steps 
            needed to be performed. 
    
        </p>

        <p>Hajj is the major and greater pilgrimage as it is one of five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory upon all muslims to perform hajj once in their lifetime.
            Though only if they are capable financially and physically
        </p>
